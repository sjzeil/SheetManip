# Sheetmanip

A collection of tools for manipulating Excel spreadsheets and CSV
 files.

Project reports are ...

* `sheetManipLib`: A library of routines for extracting/inserting 
    information from/to Excel workbooks, mainly as CSV files.
    
    * Extract or insert sheets of a workbook as CSV.
    * Prepare individual grade reports (HTML) for students
      whose grade info is stored by rows in a spreadsheet,
      with each row flagged by the identifier of the student.
      Students are only shown the rows matching their name or
      that have no identifier at all.    

* `sheetManip`: Executable applications that provide access to the
        `sheetmanipLib` functions.
